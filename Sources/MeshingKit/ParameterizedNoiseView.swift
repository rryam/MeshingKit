///
/// Use `ParameterizedNoiseView` to add a customizable noise effect to a `MeshGradient` view.
/// The noise effect is controlled by three parameters: intensity, frequency, and opacity.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// ParameterizedNoiseView(intensity: .constant(0.5), frequency: .constant(0.2), opacity: .constant(0.9)) {
///   MeshingKit.gradientSize3(template: .cosmicAurora)
/// }
/// ```
